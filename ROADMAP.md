## 🚀 Planned Features

### 🧠 Smart Menu Finder
**Description:**  
Automatically find a restaurant’s menu using only its name.  
The BackEnd or AI module will handle the search and data retrieval from available online sources.

---

### 📍 Nearby Daily Menus
**Description:**  
Display daily menus of all nearby restaurants based on the user’s current location.  
The system will use geolocation to identify surrounding restaurants and show today’s offers.

---

### 🍽️ AI Meal Recommendations
**Description:**  
If no daily menu is found, the AI will select **three recommended meals** based on:  
- the restaurant’s cuisine type,  
- popular dishes in the area,  
- and seasonal or trending meals.

---

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Integration with Google Maps for restaurant visualization.  
- Filters by cuisine type or dietary preferences.  
- User accounts with favorites and saved restaurant history.  
- Optional notifications for daily lunch updates.
