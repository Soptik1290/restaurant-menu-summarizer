# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Menu Summarizer

**Live Application:** [**https://stark-dev.tech**](https://stark-dev.tech)

## üìñ About The Project

This project is a full-stack web application designed to fetch, parse, and summarize the daily menu from a restaurant's website, image, or PDF URL. It uses an AI model (OpenAI) via tool calling to extract structured menu data and caches the results in Redis.

The application is fully containerized with Docker and features a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automatic testing and deployment to a Hetzner Cloud VPS.

This project fulfills all core requirements, mandatory tasks (caching, testing), and several bonus objectives (Docker, FE design, advanced error handling, E2E tests) of the DXH AI Developer technical task.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Format Input:** Accepts a URL for a restaurant's menu, supporting:
  - **HTML** pages (parsed with Cheerio)
  - **Images** (PNG, JPG, etc., processed by a Tesseract OCR microservice)
  - **PDF** files (processed by a Pdfplumber microservice)
- **AI Extraction:** Uses OpenAI (GPT-5-mini) with Tool Calling to extract structured JSON data (name, price, category, etc.).
- **Smart Date Handling:** Prompt is engineered to find the menu for the current day, including complex cases like "Weekend Menus" or pages with incorrect date formatting.
- **Persistent Caching:** Caches successful results in **Redis** (keyed by URL + Date, 1-hour TTL) to reduce API calls and improve speed.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Frontend displays user-friendly messages for 404s, timeouts, unsupported file types, or if the AI detects the restaurant is closed.
- **Polished Frontend:**
  - Dark mode UI with "frosted glass" effects using **Tailwind CSS**.
  - Animated emoji background for visual appeal.
  - Interactive "Dynamic Island" style input pill for submitting new URLs or refreshing.
  - Side-by-side JSON viewer with a "Copy to Clipboard" button.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - **Continuous Integration (CI):** On every push, GitHub Actions automatically runs backend unit tests, backend E2E tests (with a live Redis service), and frontend build tests.
  - **Continuous Deployment (CD):** On a successful push to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically builds and pushes new Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), then connects to the production server via SSH to pull the new images and restart the application.
- **Production Deployment:**
  - Hosted on a **Hetzner Cloud VPS**.
  - Served via a **Nginx Reverse Proxy** (running on the host) for routing.
  - Secured with **HTTPS** using a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate (managed by Certbot).

    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx
    ```

    ```dotenv
    OCR_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```
8.  **Create Client `.env` file:** Vytvo≈ô `client/.env` pro `npm start`:
    ```dotenv
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ```
    _(V≈°echny `.env` soubory jsou ignorov√°ny souborem `.gitignore`)_

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Production Deployment (Hetzner & CI/CD)

This project is automatically deployed to `https://stark-dev.tech` using GitHub Actions.

- **CI (`ci.yml`):** Runs on every push/PR. It executes backend unit tests, backend E2E tests (against a live Redis service), and the frontend build.
- **CD (`cd.yml`):** Runs **only on push to `main`** (after CI succeeds).
  1.  Builds and pushes Docker images for `server`, `ocr`, and `client` to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
  2.  Uses SSH to connect to the Hetzner VPS.
  3.  Copies the `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `.env` file (created from GitHub Secrets) to the server.
  4.  Logs into GHCR, pulls the new images, and restarts the services using `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.

The live server uses Nginx as a reverse proxy (running on the host) to route traffic from `https://stark-dev.tech` to the appropriate containers and provides an SSL certificate via Certbot.

## üí° Design Considerations & Choices

- **Technology Choice:** The core technologies (NestJS, React, Redis, Docker) were largely based on the recommendations provided in the task description. These represent modern and commonly used tools.
- **Learning Curve:** As I had limited prior experience with several of these tools (particularly NestJS, React, and CI/CD pipelines), a significant part of the development process involved learning them. This was achieved by following tutorials, reading documentation, and utilizing AI assistance to troubleshoot implementation details.
- **Microservice Architecture:** Recognizing the different requirements for OCR/PDF processing, a dedicated Python/FastAPI microservice was created. This keeps the main NestJS backend clean and focused purely on orchestration and AI logic.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions was chosen to automate testing and deployment. The pipeline separates testing (CI) from deployment (CD), building and pushing images to GHCR for a robust and fast deployment to the Hetzner VPS.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented specific error handling for common issues (404s, timeouts, unsupported types, AI failures) to provide clearer feedback on the frontend. The AI prompt was also refined to detect "closed" statuses.
- **AI Implementation:** OpenAI API was used with Tool Calling to enforce the required structured JSON output. The prompt was iteratively refined in Czech to handle specific cases like weekly/weekend menus.
- **Simplicity vs. Completeness:** Features like AI-based allergen guessing were omitted due to potential inaccuracy and safety concerns. The focus was on delivering a robust core functionality cleanly.

## üîÆ Future Improvements / Discussion Points

### üó∫Ô∏è Planned Features (Roadmap)

- **Smart Menu Finder:** Automatically find a restaurant‚Äôs menu using only its name. The backend/AI would handle searching online sources.
- **Nearby Daily Menus:** Display daily menus of nearby restaurants based on user geolocation.
- **AI Meal Recommendations:** If no daily menu is found, have the AI suggest three recommended meals based on cuisine type, local popularity, and seasonal trends.

### üí¨ Other Potential Ideas

- **Prompt Refinement:** Further improve the AI prompt to handle even more complex or unusual menu structures.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Implement more sophisticated cache invalidation (e.g., shorter TTL around lunchtime).
- **Authentication:** Add simple API key or JWT authentication as suggested.
- **Advanced Features (From ROADMAP):**
  - Integration with Google Maps for visualization.
  - Filters by cuisine type or dietary preferences.
  - User accounts for saving favorites.
  - Notifications for daily lunch updates.

### ü§î Discussion Points

- **AI Allergen Guessing:** While omitted for safety, the feasibility and reliability of AI predicting potential allergens based on dish names could be discussed.
- **Tesseract Accuracy:** For OCR, Tesseract's accuracy can vary. Exploring alternative OCR services (cloud-based or other models) could be a future step if accuracy is insufficient.
- **PDF Complexity:** Currently handles text extraction from PDFs. More complex PDFs with layered text or unusual formatting might require more advanced parsing techniques.
